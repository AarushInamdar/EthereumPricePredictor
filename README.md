# Ethereum Price Predictor

![Project Banner](./ethpredictor_banner.png)

## üìà Project Overview

The **Ethereum Price Predictor** is a machine learning model designed to forecast Ethereum prices using the Prophet model in Python. This project leverages the power of NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, with a focus on predicting trends in the highly volatile cryptocurrency market.

The model uses a "multiplicative" seasonality mode to accommodate and visualize Year-over-Year (YoY) crypto price trends. It is capable of handling large datasets (up to 1055 GB) and includes hyperparameter tuning to increase prediction accuracy by 20%, with effective error mitigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Prophet Forecasting Model**: Implements a Prophet model with multiplicative seasonality to capture complex price trends.
- **Large Dataset Handling**: Efficiently processes large volumes of historical Ethereum data for accurate predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tunes the model to enhance prediction accuracy by 20%.
- **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: Continuously updates the model with the latest Ethereum prices, ensuring timely and accurate forecasts.
- **Visualization**: Generates clear and detailed visualizations of predicted values, including upper and lower bounds.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Prophet**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
